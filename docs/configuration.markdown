title: Configuration

## Configuration

`wezterm` will look for a TOML configuration file in `$HOME/.config/wezterm/wezterm.toml`,
and then in `$HOME/.wezterm.toml`, stopping at the first file it finds.

`wezterm` will watch the config file that it loads; if/when it changes, the configuration
will be automatically reloaded and the majority of options will take effect immediately.

Configuration is currently very simple and the format is considered unstable and subject
to change.  The code for configuration can be found in [`src/config.rs`](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/blob/master/src/config.rs).


### Font Related Configuration

The following options impact how text is rendered:

```toml
# The font size, measured in points
font_size = 11

# The DPI to assume, measured in dots-per-inch
# This is not automatically probed!  If you experience blurry text
# or notice slight differences when comparing with other terminal
# emulators, you may wish to tune this value!
dpi = 96
```

The baseline font is configured via the `[[font.font]]` section:

```toml
[[font.font]]
# The font family name.  The default is "Menlo" on macOS,
# "Consolas" on Windows and "monospace" on X11 based systems.
# "Fira Code" to enjoy ligatures without buying an expensive font!
family = "Operator Mono SSm Lig Medium"
# Whether the font should be a bold variant
# bold = false
# Whether the font should be an italic variant
# italic = false
```

You may specify rules that apply different font styling based on
the attributes of the text rendered in the terminal.  Rules are
applied in the order that they are specified in the configuration
file, stopping with the first matching rule.

```
# Define a rule that matches when italic text is shown
[[font_rules]]
# If specified, this rule matches when a cell's italic value exactly
# matches this.  If unspecified, the attribute value is irrelevant
# with respect to matching.
italic = true

# Match based on intensity: "Bold", "Normal" and "Half" are supported
# intensity = "Normal"

# Match based on underline: "None", "Single", and "Double" are supported
# underline = "None"

# Match based on the blink attribute: "None", "Slow", "Rapid"
# blink = "None"

# Match based on reverse video
# reverse = false

# Match based on strikethrough
# strikethrough = false

# Match based on the invisible attribute
# invisible = false

  # When the above attributes match, apply this font styling
  [font_rules.font]
  font = [{family = "Operator Mono SSm Lig Medium", italic=true}]

```

Here's an example from my configuration file:

```
# Select a fancy italic font for italic text
[[font_rules]]
italic = true
  [font_rules.font]
  font = [{family = "Operator Mono SSm Lig Medium", italic=true}]

# Similarly, a fancy bold+italic font
[[font_rules]]
italic = true
intensity = "Bold"
  [font_rules.font]
  font = [{family = "Operator Mono SSm Lig", italic=true, bold=true}]

# Make regular bold text a different color to make it stand out even more
[[font_rules]]
intensity = "Bold"
  [font_rules.font]
  font = [{family = "Operator Mono SSm", bold=true}]
  foreground="tomato"

# For half-intensity text, use a lighter weight font
[[font_rules]]
intensity = "Half"
  [font_rules.font]
  font=[{family = "Operator Mono SSm Lig Light" }]
```

### Misc configuration

```toml
# How many lines of scrollback you want to retain per tab
scrollback_lines = 3500

# If no `prog` is specified on the command line, use this
# instead of running the user's shell.
# The value is the argument array, with the 0th element being
# the executable to run.  The path will be searched to locate
# this if needed.
# For example, to have `wezterm` always run `top` by default,
# you'd use this:
default_prog = ["top"]

# What to set the TERM variable to
term = "xterm-256color"

# Constrains the rate at which output from a child command is
# processed and applied to the terminal model.
# This acts as a brake in the case of a command spewing a
# ton of output and allows for the UI to remain responsive
# so that you can hit CTRL-C to interrupt it if desired.
# The default value is 200,000 bytes/s.
ratelimit_output_bytes_per_second = 200_000

# Constrains the rate at which the multiplexer server will
# unilaterally push data to the client.
# This helps to avoid saturating the link between the client
# and server.
# Each time the screen is updated as a result of the child
# command outputting data (rather than in response to input
# from the client), the server considers whether to push
# the result to the client.
# That decision is throttled by this configuration value
# which has a default value of 10/s
ratelimit_mux_output_pushes_per_second = 10

# Constrain how often the mux server scans the terminal
# model to compute a diff to send to the mux client.
# The default value is 100/s
ratelimit_mux_output_scans_per_second = 100
```

### Shortcut / Key Binding Assignments

The default key bindings are:

| `SUPER`     | `7`      | `ActivateTab(6)` |
| `SUPER`     | `8`      | `ActivateTab(7)` |
| `SUPER`     | `9`      | `ActivateTab(8)` |

| `CTRL|SHIFT`     | `9`      | `ActivateTab(8)` |
| `SUPER\|SHIFT` | `[` | `ActivateTabRelative(-1)` |
| `SUPER\|SHIFT` | `]` | `ActivateTabRelative(1)` |

These can be overridden using the `keys` section in your `~/.wezterm.toml` config file.
For example, you can disable a default assignment like this:

```
# Turn off the default CMD-m Hide action
[[keys]]
key = "m"
mods = "CMD"
action = "Nop"
```

The `key` value can be one of the following keycode identifiers.  Note that not
all of these are meaningful on all platforms:

`Hyper`, `Super`, `Meta`, `Cancel`, `Backspace`, `Tab`, `Clear`, `Enter`,
`Shift`, `Escape`, `LeftShift`, `RightShift`, `Control`, `LeftControl`,
`RightControl`, `Alt`, `LeftAlt`, `RightAlt`, `Menu`, `LeftMenu`, `RightMenu`,
`Pause`, `CapsLock`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `End`, `Home`, `LeftArrow`,
`RightArrow`, `UpArrow`, `DownArrow`, `Select`, `Print`, `Execute`,
`PrintScreen`, `Insert`, `Delete`, `Help`, `LeftWindows`, `RightWindows`,
`Applications`, `Sleep`, `Numpad0`, `Numpad1`, `Numpad2`, `Numpad3`,
`Numpad4`, `Numpad5`, `Numpad6`, `Numpad7`, `Numpad8`, `Numpad9`, `Multiply`,
`Add`, `Separator`, `Subtract`, `Decimal`, `Divide`, `NumLock`, `ScrollLock`,
`BrowserBack`, `BrowserForward`, `BrowserRefresh`, `BrowserStop`,
`BrowserSearch`, `BrowserFavorites`, `BrowserHome`, `VolumeMute`,
`VolumeDown`, `VolumeUp`, `MediaNextTrack`, `MediaPrevTrack`, `MediaStop`,
`MediaPlayPause`, `ApplicationLeftArrow`, `ApplicationRightArrow`,
`ApplicationUpArrow`, `ApplicationDownArrow`.

Alternatively, a single unicode character can be specified to indicate
pressing the corresponding key.

Possible Modifier labels are:

 * `SUPER`, `CMD`, `WIN` - these are all equivalent: on macOS the `Command` key,
   on Windows the `Windows` key, on Linux this can also be the `Super` or `Hyper`
   key.  Left and right are equivalent.
 * `SHIFT` - The shift key.  Left and right are equivalent.
 * `ALT`, `OPT`, `META` - these are all equivalent: on macOS the `Option` key,
   on other systems the `Alt` or `Meta` key.  Left and right are equivalent.

You can combine modifiers using the `|` symbol (eg: `"CMD|CTRL"`).

Possible actions are listed below.  Some actions require a parameter that is
specified via the `arg` key; see examples below.

| Name               | Effect             |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `SpawnTab`         | Create a new local tab in the current window |
| `SpawnTabInCurrentTabDomain` | Create a new tab in the current window. The tab will be spawned in the same domain as the currently active tab |
| `SpawnTabInDomain` | Create a new tab in the current window. The tab will be spawned in the domain specified by the `arg` value |
| `SpawnWindow`      | Create a new window |
| `ToggleFullScreen` | Toggles full screen mode for current window |
| `Paste`            | Paste the clipboard to the current tab |
| `ActivateTabRelative` | Activate a tab relative to the current tab.  The `arg` value specifies an offset. eg: `-1` activates the tab to the left of the current tab, while `1` activates the tab to the right. |
| `ActivateTab` | Activate the tab specified by the `arg` value. eg: `0` activates the leftmost tab, while `1` activates the second tab from the left, and so on. |
| `IncreaseFontSize` | Increases the font size of the current window by 10% |
| `DecreaseFontSize` | Decreases the font size of the current window by 10% |
| `ResetFontSize` | Reset the font size for the current window to the value in your configuration |
| `SendString` | Sends the string specified by the `arg` value to the terminal in the current tab, as though that text were literally typed into the terminal. |
| `Nop` | Does nothing.  This is useful to disable a default key assignment. |
| `Hide` | Hides the current window |
| `Show` | Shows the current window |
| `CloseCurrentTab` | Equivalent to clicking the `x` on the window title bar to close it: Closes the current tab.  If that was the last tab, closes that window.  If that was the last window, wezterm terminates. |

Example:

```toml
# Turn off the default CMD-m Hide action
[[keys]]
key = "m"
mods = "CMD"
action = "Nop"

# Macro for sending in some boiler plate.  This types `wtf!?` each
# time CMD+SHIFT+W is pressed
[[keys]]
key = "W"
mods = "CMD|SHIFT"
action = "SendString"
arg = "wtf!?"

# CTRL+ALT+0 activates the leftmost tab
[[keys]]
key = "0"
mods = "CTRL|ALT"
action = "ActivateTab"
# the tab number
arg = "0"

# CMD+y spawns a new tab in Domain 1
[[keys]]
key = "y"
mods = "CMD"
action = "SpawnTabInDomain"
# the domain ID
arg = "1"
```

### Colors

You can configure colors with a section like this.  In addition to specifying
[SVG/CSS3 color names](https://docs.rs/palette/0.4.1/palette/named/index.html#constants),
you can use `#RRGGBB` to specify a color code using the
usual hex notation; eg: `#000000` is equivalent to `black`:

```toml
[colors]
foreground = "silver"
background = "black"
cursor_bg = "springgreen"
ansi = ["black", "maroon", "green", "olive", "navy", "purple", "teal", "silver"]
brights = ["grey", "red", "lime", "yellow", "blue", "fuchsia", "aqua", "white"]
```

You can find a variety of color schemes [here](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).
There are two ways to use them with wezterm:

* [The wezterm directory](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/wezterm) contains
  configuration snippets that you can copy and paste into your `wezterm.toml` file
  to set the default configuration.
* [The dynamic-colors directory](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/dynamic-colors)
  contains shell scripts that can change the color scheme immediately on the fly.
  This is super convenient for trying out color schemes, and can be used in
  your own scripts to alter the terminal appearance programmatically:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.git
$ cd iTerm2-Color-Schemes/dynamic-colors
$ for scheme in *.sh ; do ; echo $scheme ; \
   bash "$scheme" ; ../tools/screenshotTable.sh; sleep 0.5; done
```
